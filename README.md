# Enhancing Tornado Forecasting through Machine Learning: A Collaborative Project
 
#### Introduction
Presented by the "UM BISON" group, this project, titled "Forecasting Tornadoes: Improving Prediction Accuracy," aims to revolutionize tornado forecasting in Canada using a machine learning approach. Acknowledging the severe impacts of tornadoes, both human and economic, the project underscores the limitations of current warning systems and the urgent need for accurate, timely predictions. Inspired by a personal account of tornado devastation, the team focuses on leveraging comprehensive U.S. tornado data and advanced machine learning algorithms.
 
#### Methodology
The methodology centers on employing machine learning to discern patterns in extensive weather and tornado data from the USA, consisting of 178,997 rows and 28 columns. The data, spanning from January 1, 1998, to January 1, 2008, was divided into training and testing sets to enhance model learning and validation. Two models were employed: Logistic Regression (LR) for its simplicity and computational efficiency, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for their proficiency in handling sequential data. LR showed an accuracy of 70%, while RNN significantly improved it to 86%.
 
#### Results
The performance of both models is evaluated using various metrics. Logistic Regression demonstrated good interpretability but limited complexity, especially in handling sequential data. On the other hand, RNN excelled in managing time-related patterns, though it required more computational resources and had a higher risk of overfitting. The ROC curve for LR indicated a decent model performance with an AUC of 0.84. RNN, trained over 10 epochs, showed promising trends in both training and validation accuracy and loss, indicating effective learning and generalization capabilities.
 
#### Collaboration and Challenges
The project's success was attributed to efficient teamwork and the guidance of a mentor, Samuel. The team faced challenges like data scarcity and initial overfitting due to dataset imbalance. Through meticulous data processing and expert advice, these challenges were effectively addressed.
 
#### Conclusion
Concluding, the project underscores the vital role of advanced forecasting in ensuring community safety. Future plans include extending these methodologies to other natural disasters, emphasizing the team's commitment to using technology for community welfare and preparedness.
